# cardSlideShowcase

**This project has a clear goal: to make the images in the slider stand out when you click on them. When you click on an image, it gets highlighted so that you can identify your choice. Additionally, the other images stop being highlighted at the same time. It's a simple and effective way to interact with the images in the slider!**
